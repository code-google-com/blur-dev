|Key|Description|settings.ini|
|:--|:----------|:-----------|
|blurdev\_path|If present the active environment name will be set to TEMPORARY(This is not saved in prefs and disappears on close.). The temporary environment will have its path set to the value. blurdev.osystem.startfile will add this to the environment variables passed to the spawned process.|False|
|blurdev\_error\_email|If blurdev\_path is present the temporary environment will have its environment variable set to this. This way you can receive error emails from the temporary environments. blurdev.osystem.startfile will add this to the environment variables passed to the spawned process if a email is set for the active environment.|False|
|legacy\_config|Used to override the config.ini file loaded in maxscript. If not provided it will load c:\blur\config.ini. See c:\blur\offline\maxscript\treeGrunt\Lib\startup\blurStartupMaxLib.ms for more details.|False|

See blurdev\resource\templ\py\_log\_to\_file.templ for a example._|True|
