#summary Currently Known Issues in the Installers

We've been getting a lot of interest for these installers, so we decided to put them on here even though they are still beta and not 100% complete.

This page has the workarounds for the known issues, but is also where you should comment on new issues that you discover while working with the system.  Thanks!

=== Installation Paths ===

We are currently working on our installers, but right now, they are hardcoded install locations:

Python 24 x32: c:/python24
Python 26 x64: c:/python26_64

3dsMax 9    x32: c:/max9
3dsMax 9    x64: c:/max9_64
3dsMax 2008 x32: c:/max10
3dsMax 2008 x64: c:/max10_64
3dsMax 2009 x32: c:/max2009
3dsMax 2009 x64: c:/max2009_64

If your local paths don't match these, then you will need to move the installed files to wherever they should be on your computer.  We'll be updating the installers soon.

=== New Script, Open Script, Run Script Broken from Menu ===

If you experience this, you'll see an error like:

{{{ PyQWinHook.core not defined }}}

If you open your PYTHON_PATH/lib/site-packages/blur/wingui/__init__.py file, simply replace:

{{{ PyQWinHook.core }}

with

{{{ core }}}

And that should solve your problem!
