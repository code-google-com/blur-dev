#summary Understanding the tools environments

= Understanding the Tools Environments =

This tutorial will walk you through how our code is structured and why.

<wiki:toc depth="4"/>

== Tools Environments ==

The Treegrunt system is built upon the ToolsEnvironment system.  This allows us to maintain and deploy tools across multiple environments simply - so we can have local, beta, gold, project, etc. environment locations that the Treegrunt can switch between.

You'll get one environment - the Blur Offline environment.  This has all of our Blur tools built as an installer and installed on your local machine at:

{{{
c:/blur/dev/offline/
}}}

This path represents a Environment.

=== appdata ===

This folder contains additional settings information pertaining to 3rd-party applications.


=== bin ===

The bin folder contains compiled versions of the DLLs that we deploy, as well as any installed scripts and is used by our installation system when creating builds.

It represents the folder structure that will be installed for different packages, so you can see what will be installed into your applications.

=== code ===

The code folder is our *new* coding location - this is where all of our source code lives, broken down by language.

For instance, python based tools will be found in:

{{{
[environment]/code/python/tools
}}}

and source code for plugins found in:
{{{
[environment]/code/cpp/plugins
}}}

We'll discuss the difference between `scripts` and `tools` in a little bit.

=== common ===

Contains reusable resources that are not coding related.

=== docs ===

Contains user and technical documentation (very limited, if any, at the moment)

=== fusion ===

*Legacy* Location for fusion scripts, will eventually migrate to `code/python` and 'code/eyeonscript`

=== maxscript ===

*Legacy* Location for all of Blur's original code base for 3dsMax & XSI tools.  Initially, this only contained maxscript tools, however, with the integration of Softimage, we began writing python tools in this trunk as well - before switching over to the new system.

=== resource ===

Additional resources - mostly used for internal use.

=== workgroups ===

Softimage plugins and scripts used to drive the Softimage addons we've developed.

== Developing Tools & Scripts ==

=== What is a tool vs. a script? ===

For the purpose of our code base - a *Tool* is a bundle of code that gets registered to the Treegrunt system and as such, follows some coding standards not enforced in scripts.

Tools will be found in:

{{{
[environment]/code/[language]/tools
}}}

Scripts will be found in:
{{{
[environment]/code/[language]/scripts
}}}
