All your standard variable types that exist in MAXScript also exist in Python - these are the variable types and their corresponding class type.

*Maxscript Variables*
{{{
a = 1        /* integer */
b = 1.0      /* float */
c = "test"   /* string */
}}}

*Python Variables*
{{{
a = 1        # int
b = 1.0      # float
c = "test"   # str
d = 'test'   # unicode - pretty much equivalent to str
}}}

All the containers from MAXScript are available in Python (including some extra ones)

*Maxscript Containers*
{{{
/* Arrays */
a = #( 1, 2, 3, 8, 20 )
print a[1]          /* result: 1  - MAXScript has 1 based arrays */
print a[a.count]    /* result: 20 - MAXScript can access the last index of their arrays */
print a.count       /* result: 5 */

a[1] = 10           /* set the item at the first index to 10 */
a[a.count] 
append a 15         /* adds item to the end of the array */
insertItem a 1 15   /* inserts 15 at the very beginning of the array */
findItem a 15       /* returns the index of the first instance of the item */
deleteItem a 1      /* deletes the item at the index 1 of the array */

/* Creating an array as a collection */
a = for obj in objects where isKindOf obj Editable_Mesh collect obj
}}}

*Python Containers*
{{{
# Lists - Python's Array
a = [ 1, 2, 3, 8, 20 ]
print a[0]          # result: 1 - Python has 0 based lists
print a[-1]         # result: 20 - Python cannot access the last index of their lists
                    # but they can do a reverse lookup: if an index is
                    # negative, then its taking the index relative to the end
print len(a)        # result: 5  - The way to calculate the length of a list

a[0] = 10           # set the item at first index to 10
a[-1] = 10          # set the item at the last index to 10
a.append( 15 )      # adds item to the end of the list
a.insert( 0, 15 )   # inserts 15 at the very beginning of the list
a.index( 15 )       # returns the index of the first instance of the item
a.remove( 15 )      # removes the first item from the desired list

# Creating a list as a collection
a = [ obj for obj in mxs.objects if mxs.isKindOf( obj, mxs.Editable_Mesh ) ]

#--------------------------

# Tuples - Static Lists
t = (1,2,3,8,20)

# Accessing is the same as lists
print a[0]
print a[-1]
print len(a)

# But you cannot change or modify tuples
a[0] = 10         # Crashes
a.append( 10 )    # Crashes
# etc.

#--------------------------

# Dictionaries - Not available in MAXscript - but these are hash table containers
# Instead of storing indexes, you can store anything as a key

d  = { 'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30 }
d2 = { 1: 'a', 20: 'b', 30: 'c' }

# Dictionaries are very useful for storing data, and is very fast lookups
# however they are not ordered, so you will not get your data back in the order you store it

print d[ 'a' ]     # Access the 'a' key
print d2[ 1 ]      # Access the 1 key

# For more information on dictionaries, visit the python documentation online
