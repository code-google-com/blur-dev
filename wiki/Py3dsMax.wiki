#summary Integration of Python and PyQt into 3d Studio Max

= What is it? =

Here at Blur we've developed a way to integrate the Python ([http://www.python.org]) programming language into the 3d Studio Max application.  By mapping the basic MAXScript value class to the basic Python PyObject class, we're able to expose MAXScript functionality as a Python module.  All maxscript methods are available using the mxs module and run the same way as they would normally in maxscript, only using a pythonic syntax.

For faster development, we've also integrated the PyQt framework to allow development of Qt applications instead of MAXScript rollouts.

= How do I get it? =

You'll need to first download the BlurCore libraries, and then decide upon which version of 3dsMax & Python you'll need.

Currently, we are supporting:

  * 3dsMax 9, 2008 (as Max10), and 2009
  * For all x32 bit versions, we're supporting Python24
  * For all x64 bit versions, we're supporting Python26

= Examples =

*Maxscript Example*
{{{
function moveToOrigin objs = (
   for o in objs do (
       print ( "Moving " + o.name + " from " + o.position as string + " to [0,0,0]" )
       o.position = [0,0,0]
   )
)

moveToOrigin( objects )
}}}

*Python Equivalent*
{{{
# Py3dsMax is the root max module created from blurPython.dlx
# mxs is an interface to the global namespace of maxscript, whatever methods or variables
# you would call globally in maxscript (e.g. objects, selection, meshOp, etc.) is
# accessible by getting it through the mxs instance (e.g. mxs.objects, mxs.selection, etc.)
from Py3dsMax import mxs 

def moveToOrigin( objs ):
   # [0,0,0] creates a Point3 in maxscript, but in python creates a list
   # so we have to actually create a Point3 instance in python to move the objects to
   origin = mxs.Point3( 0, 0, 0 ) 
   for o in objs:
      print "Moving %s from %s to [0,0,0]." % (o.name,o.position)
      o.position = origin

moveToOrigin( mxs.objects )
}}}
