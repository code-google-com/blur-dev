#summary Tools and Workgroup designed for Softimage | XSI

== Prerequisites ==
 # *Softimage | XSI* (http://www.softimage.com/)
 # *Python* (http://www.python.org/download/)
  * *Q: What is Python?*
  * *A:* Python is a free, powerful scripting language commonly used in 3d production.  We've decided to use it here at Blur for the basis of most of our scripts and tools and has become an integral part of our pipeline
  * *Q: What version do I need?*
  * *A:* Depending on the installer you choose, you will need different versions.  Mostly, we've been using Python24 to date, but will be upgrading soon to Python26 & Python26_64 for x64 bit support.  The version & bit information is in the installer name you choose - so for example, BlurSoftimage_python24_x32 is for 32 bit XSI, python24.

== Installation ==
 # Go to the [http://code.google.com/p/blur-dev/downloads downloads] page and select the latest installer for the python version you want.
 # Run the installer, this will install code in a variety of places:
  # A config file with all your path mappings will be placed in c:/blur/config.ini (the default settings should suffice, but if you want to point paths elsewhere for the tools, you can)
  # Your default projects location will be c:/blur/projects
  # The blur python package will be installed in your PYTHON_PATH/lib/site-packages folder
  # The blur python libraries will be installed in c:/blur/dev/offline/code/maxscript/lib
  # The blur Softimage Workgroup will be installed in c:/blur/dev/offline/code/maxscript/treegrunt (which we will discuss a bit more in a minute
