#summary Tools and Workgroup designed for Softimage | XSI
#labels Documentation

== Prerequisites ==
 # *Softimage | XSI* (http://www.softimage.com/)
 # *Python* (http://www.python.org/download/)
  * *Q: What is Python?*
  * *A:* Python is a free, powerful scripting language commonly used in 3d production.  We've decided to use it here at Blur for the basis of most of our scripts and tools and has become an integral part of our pipeline
  * *Q: What version do I need?*
  * *A:* Depending on the installer you choose, you will need different versions.  Mostly, we've been using Python24 to date, but will be upgrading soon to Python26 & Python26_64 for x64 bit support.  The version & bit information is in the installer name you choose - so for example, BlurSoftimage_python24_x32 is for 32 bit XSI, python24.

== Installation ==
 # Go to the [http://code.google.com/p/blur-dev/downloads downloads] page and select the latest installer for the python version you want.
 # Run the installer, this will install code in a variety of places
 # Once you have run the installer, startup XSI
 # Go to File->Plugin Manager, click on Workgroups->Connect...
 # This will bring up a folder picker, navigate to the blur Workgroup in c:/blur/dev/offline/code/maxscript/treegrunt/XSIWorkgroup
 # If everything is installed correctly, you should receive no errors on the connect, and you should see a Blur menu at the top of your XSI session.  Just click that to bring up the TreeGrunt utility, and you're all connected to the Blur Softimage Toolset!
