=== Layouts ===

Ok, so we have a dialog with a button...whoop-dee-do.  It still looks pretty bad, what can we do that is better than in Maxscript?

In 3dsMax, if you COULD resize a rolloutcontrol, you'd be responsible for all the resizing code for it - which often time was a large enough pain that no one did it.

Qt removes the need for that with these things called Layouts.  Lets build a more exciting dialog this time shall we?

From here on out, I am done with the Maxscript corresponding code - it would require a lot of coding, along with knowledge and implementation of ActiveX or DotNet rollout controls...and I have used those enough to know I never want to use those again.

*Python*
{{{
from blur.wingui  import Dialog

from PyQt4.QtGui  import QHBoxLayout      # Spread widgets horizontally
from PyQt4.QtGui  import QVBoxLayout      # Spread widgets vertically

from PyQt4.QtGui  import QPushButton
from PyQt4.QtGui  import QTreeWidget      # Lets add a tree to the dialog...why not? its easy!

class TestDialog( Dialog ):
   def __init__( self ):
      Dialog.__init__( self )

      # Create the main layout
      layout = QVBoxLayout()
      
      # Add a tree
      self.uiObjectTREE = QTreeWidget( self )  # Create a tree, as a child of this dialog
      layout.addWidget( self.uiObjectTREE )    # Add the tree to the layout

      # Add buttons
      self.uiOkBTN = QPushButton( self )
      self.uiOkBTN.setText( 'Ok' )
      
      self.uiCancelBTN = QPushButton( self )
      self.uiCancelBTN.setText( 'Cancel' )

      # Lay the buttons out horizontally
      hlayout = QHBoxLayout()
      hlayout.addWidget( self.uiOkBTN )
      hlayout.addWidget( self.uiCancelBTN )

      # Add the horizontal layout to the main one
      layout.addLayout( hlayout )

      # Set the dialogs layout to hold all these widgets
      self.setLayout( layout )

# Create the dialog
dialog = TestDialog()
dialog.show()
}}}

=== Loading Data ===

Lets now populate the tree with some data from Max

*Python*
{{{
from blur.wingui  import Dialog

from PyQt4.QtGui  import QHBoxLayout      # Spread widgets horizontally
from PyQt4.QtGui  import QVBoxLayout      # Spread widgets vertically

from PyQt4.QtGui  import QPushButton
from PyQt4.QtGui  import QTreeWidget      # Lets add a tree to the dialog...why not? its easy!
from PyQt4.QtGui  import QTreeWidgetItem

from Py3dsMax     import mxs              # Bring in the maxscript module

# Lets subclass a TreeWidget item so we can store objects with them
class ObjectItem( QTreeWidgetItem ):
   def __init__( self, msobject ):
       QTreeWidgetItem.__init__( self, [ msobject.name ] )
       self._msobject = msobject
       
       # Add the children of this item
       for child in msobject.children:
           self.addChild( ObjectItem( child ) )
   
   def msobject( self ):
       return self._msobject

class TestDialog( Dialog ):
   def __init__( self ):
      Dialog.__init__( self )

      # Create the main layout
      layout = QVBoxLayout()
      
      # Add a tree
      self.uiObjectTREE = QTreeWidget( self )  # Create a tree, as a child of this dialog
      layout.addWidget( self.uiObjectTREE )    # Add the tree to the layout

      # Add buttons
      self.uiOkBTN = QPushButton( self )
      self.uiOkBTN.setText( 'Ok' )
      
      self.uiCancelBTN = QPushButton( self )
      self.uiCancelBTN.setText( 'Cancel' )

      # Lay the buttons out horizontally
      hlayout = QHBoxLayout()
      hlayout.addWidget( self.uiOkBTN )
      hlayout.addWidget( self.uiCancelBTN )

      # Add the horizontal layout to the main one
      layout.addLayout( hlayout )

      # Set the dialogs layout to hold all these widgets
      self.setLayout( layout )

      # Load the scene object hierarchy
      self.uiObjectTREE.addTopLevelItem( ObjectItem( mxs.rootNode ) )

# Create the dialog
dialog = TestDialog()
dialog.show()
}}}

=== Connections ===

Next step is setting up user interactions with the interface.  Qt controls its events through a signal/slot relationship.  Widgets emit out SIGNALs that you can connect methods to to run (for more information on this view [http://qt.nokia.com/ Qt SDK])

*Python*
{{{
from blur.wingui  import Dialog

from PyQt4.QtCore import SIGNAL           # Signal mapping method for Qt

from PyQt4.QtGui  import QHBoxLayout      # Spread widgets horizontally
from PyQt4.QtGui  import QVBoxLayout      # Spread widgets vertically

from PyQt4.QtGui  import QPushButton
from PyQt4.QtGui  import QTreeWidget      # Lets add a tree to the dialog...why not? its easy!
from PyQt4.QtGui  import QTreeWidgetItem

from Py3dsMax     import mxs              # Bring in the maxscript module

# Lets subclass a TreeWidget item so we can store objects with them
class ObjectItem( QTreeWidgetItem ):
   def __init__( self, msobject ):
       QTreeWidgetItem.__init__( self, [ msobject.name ] )
       self._msobject = msobject
       
       # Add the children of this item
       for child in msobject.children:
           self.addChild( ObjectItem( child ) )
   
   def msobject( self ):
       return self._msobject

class TestDialog( Dialog ):
   def __init__( self ):
      Dialog.__init__( self )

      # Lets break the constructor up so its easier to manage

      self._build()   # Generate the widgets
      self._connect() # Connect the signals/slots
      self.refresh()  # Load the data

   def _build( self ):
      # Create the main layout
      layout = QVBoxLayout()
      
      # Add a tree
      self.uiObjectTREE = QTreeWidget( self )  # Create a tree, as a child of this dialog
      layout.addWidget( self.uiObjectTREE )    # Add the tree to the layout

      # Add buttons
      self.uiRefreshBTN = QPushButton( self )
      self.uiRefreshBTN.setText( 'Refresh' )

      self.uiOkBTN = QPushButton( self )
      self.uiOkBTN.setText( 'Ok' )
      
      self.uiCancelBTN = QPushButton( self )
      self.uiCancelBTN.setText( 'Cancel' )

      # Lay the buttons out horizontally
      hlayout = QHBoxLayout()
      hlayout.addWidget( self.uiRefreshBTN )
      hlayout.addWidget( self.uiOkBTN )
      hlayout.addWidget( self.uiCancelBTN )

      # Add the horizontal layout to the main one
      layout.addLayout( hlayout )

      # Set the dialogs layout to hold all these widgets
      self.setLayout( layout )

   def _connect( self ):
      # Create connections between the different widgets
      self.connect( self.uiRefreshBTN, SIGNAL( 'clicked()' ), self.refresh ) # custom method
      self.connect( self.uiOkBTN,      SIGNAL( 'clicked()' ), self.accept ) # built-in dialog method
      self.connect( self.uiCancelBTN,  SIGNAL( 'clicked()' ), self.reject ) # built-in dialog method
      self.connect( self.uiObjectTREE, SIGNAL( 'itemClicked(QTreeWidgetItem*,int)' ), self.itemClicked ) # custom method

   def itemClicked( self, item, column ):
      # Select objects in the scene when they are selected in the tree
      if ( item.parent() ):
         # Make sure we dont try to select the root node, or max will crash
         mxs.select( item.msobject() )

   def refresh( self ):
      self.uiObjectTREE.clear()

      # Load the scene object hierarchy
      self.uiObjectTREE.addTopLevelItem( ObjectItem( mxs.rootNode ) )

# Create the dialog
dialog = TestDialog()
dialog.show()

This is only scratching the surface of the possibilities with Python and Qt.  For more information, and more signals, you'll have to look up help online or see the documentation for Qt (which is very, very well written and documented)

You can see Qt's Website [http://qt.nokia.com here]

=== Qt Designer ===

One of the main strengths that you can get from Qt is the Designer.  Qt does a good job of creating a true separation between code and graphics.

You can drag and drop widgets onto your dialog, save out an xml (.ui) file that can be loaded in on the fly.  It also has Layouts.  Layouts allow you to easily create *resizable* dialogs (something that was always a problem in Maxscript rollouts)

This can really ease your workflow - I recommend looking into it.
