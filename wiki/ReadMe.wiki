== Softimage extra instructions ==

There are a few extra steps required to use BlurOffline in Softimage.

=== Use python installed with windows ===
In Softimage 2012 and newer you need tell xsi to not use its own python. Skip this step for older versions of Softimage
 # Open the preferences. Select File -> Preferences...
 # In the preferences dialog select Scripting
 # Uncheck Use Python Installed with Softimage(Windows Only)
=== Patch pywin32 ===
Softimage will use the last installed version of pywin32 to run python code.
 # Navigate to your python install folder. If you installed python and pywin32 using the BlurOffline installer it will most likely be c:\python26 for Softimage 64bit, and c:\python24 for Softimage 32bit.
 # Now browse to the correct file. Lib\site-packages\win32com\client\__init__.py
 # Replace it with this file
