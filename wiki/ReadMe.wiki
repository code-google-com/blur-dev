= Softimage extra instructions =

There are a few extra steps required to use BlurOffline in Softimage.

== Remove the Qt dlls installed with Softimage ==
Newer versions of Softimage come with qt dlls that will prevent the tools from running, they need to be moved outside of the bin folder.
 # Navigate to the softimage bin directory.
  # Right click on the desktop icon for Softimage and select Properties.
  # Click on Open File Location. This should take you to the Application\bin folder
 # Create a new folder called qt_backup
 # Move these files into the newly created folder.
  * !QtCore4.dll
  * !QtGui4.dll
  * QtOpenGL4.dll
  * !QtXml4.dll

== Use python installed with windows ==
In Softimage 2012 and newer you need tell xsi to not use its own python. Skip this step for older versions of Softimage
 # In Softimage, open the preferences. Select File -> Preferences...
 # In the preferences dialog select Scripting
 # Uncheck Use Python Installed with Softimage(Windows Only)
== Connect to the workgroups ==
 # In Softimage, open the Plug-in Manager. Select File -> Plug-in Manager...
 # Select the Workgroups tab.
 # Add the workgroups *in this order*.
  * C:\blur\dev\offline\workgroups\xsi_blurdev
  * C:\blur\dev\offline\workgroups\xsi_common
  # Repeat these steps for each path. 
   # Click Connect...
   # Paste the folder path in the text box labeled Pick the root location of an existing workgroup. Then click Ok

== Restart Softimage ==
