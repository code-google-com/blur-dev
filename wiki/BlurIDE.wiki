#summary Introduction to the Blur IDE

= Blur IDE Documentation =

To fully integrate Python into 3dsMax, we set out to build a simple editor using the Python & PyQt system that we had setup.  This led us to develop the Blur IDE system.

Built using the QScintilla plugin for Qt for highlighting, the editor is a lightweight, yet powerful editing program that is cross-platform, as well as cross-application.

It runs as a standalone application, as well as a nested program within 3dsMax and Softimage for rapid development.

Found in the PYTHON_PATH/lib/site-packages/blurdev/ide package, the system includes:

=== Code Editor ===

=== Treegrunt ===

=== Logger ===

=== SDK Window ===
