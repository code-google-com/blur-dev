=== Py3dsMax and "__main__" ===
When running scripts using the logger's {{{Evaluate}}} scripts are not run as {{{__main__}}}.

Using Python -> Run Script and Python -> Logger -> Run Script will execute scripts as {{{__main__}}}. {{{Py3dsMax.runScript()}}} will also execute the script in the top-level environment.
