#summary Difference between Structs and Classes

= Structs & Classes =

In Maxscript you have the ability to create structs of data.  In Python, classes can do everything you can in a Maxscript struct - and oh so much more.

*Maxscript Struct*
{{{
/* create a struct */
struct MyStruct (
  _myInt     = 10,
  _myArray   = #( a, b, c ),
  _myString  = 'Test',

  function addItem item = (
      append _myArray item
  ),
  function printAll = (
      print _myInt
      print _myArray
      print _myString
  )
)

instA = MyStruct()
instA.addItem( 10 )
instA.printAll()

instB = MyStruct()
instB.addItem( 4 )
instB.printAll()
}}}

=== Object-Oriented Programming ===

Python is an Object-Oriented programming language, which means you can quickly and easily manage inheritance in your objects, something that Maxscript always lacked.
