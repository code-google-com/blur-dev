*Maxscript Example*
{{{
function moveToOrigin objs = (
   for o in objs do (
       print ( "Moving " + o.name + " from " + o.position as string + " to [0,0,0]" )
       o.position = [0,0,0]
   )
)

moveToOrigin( objects )
}}}

*Python Equivalent*
{{{
# Py3dsMax is the root max module created from blurPython.dlx
# mxs is an interface to the global namespace of maxscript, whatever methods or variables
# you would call globally in maxscript (e.g. objects, selection, meshOp, etc.) is
# accessible by getting it through the mxs instance (e.g. mxs.objects, mxs.selection, etc.)
from Py3dsMax import mxs 

def moveToOrigin( objs ):
   # [0,0,0] creates a Point3 in maxscript, but in python creates a list
   # so we have to actually create a Point3 instance in python to move the objects to
   origin = mxs.Point3( 0, 0, 0 ) 
   for o in objs:
      print "Moving %s from %s to [0,0,0]." % (o.name,o.position)
      o.position = origin

moveToOrigin( mxs.objects )
