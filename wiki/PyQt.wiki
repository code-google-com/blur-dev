= Introduction to PyQt =

If you are completely new to Python and/or PyQt, then I would recommend working through some online tutorials - there are a TON of them out there.

This tutorial is about working with PyQt as it relates to the Blur systems, not a basic introduction to PyQt in general.

The tutorials on this page are for generic development - everything in these docs can and does apply to code for 3dsMax and Softimage - as the system we developed is application agnostic.

== Pre-requistes ==

I'm assuming that you've read through the [BlurIDE] documentation and are setup with the BlurOffline code project.

== Hello, World ==

Everyone's favorite - Hello World.

For this example, we'll go into a couple of differences between the basics of PyQt and the system that we have in place.

First up, fire open your IDE Editor (can be standalone, or in an application of choice) and make sure we are in the BlurOffline project.

Click {{{ Ctrl+N }}} or {{{ File >> New }}} and type:

{{{
# import the dialog base class
# note, this is not QDialog from PyQt4.QtGui,
# as will explain in a minute

from blurdev.gui import Dialog

# create our own dialog class
class HelloWorldDialog(Dialog):
    def __init__( self, parent = None ):
        Dialog.__init__( self, parent )
        
        self.setWindowTitle('Hello, World')

import blurdev
blurdev.launch(HelloWorldDialog)
}}}
