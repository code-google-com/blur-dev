== Accessing 3dsMax Values ==

So, now that we know a little bit about the basic differences and similarities between MAXScript and Python as languages...how do we work with Python and 3dsMax together?

The blurPython dll generates a Py3dsMax python module from which you can access basic 3dsMax values and methods.  The main one you'll be working with is the mxs submodule:

{{{
from Py3dsMax import mxs
}}}

=== What is the mxs module? ===
