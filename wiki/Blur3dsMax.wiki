== Production Tools ==

The Production Tools are the scripts that are specifically designed to push shots and assets through our pipeline here at Blur.  They may be useful for people outside the studio, but their main use is for pipeline specific needs here - feel free to browse and use, but they may not work for you unless you have installed the full studio toolset.

 * *blurSelectByName* - _selection window with renaming using blur's naming convention_
 * *Element Storm* - _beta level node-based system for managing scene states (requires 3rd-Party Heliumn 3dsMax controller)_
 * *Quick Name* - _simple renaming using fast C++ algorithm from BlurDLX.dlx, renames thousands of objects in milliseconds_
 * *Render Elements* - _render Pass/Element tools to save and load scene states_
 * *TreeGrunt* - _access all the scripts available on the network_
 * *the Onion* - _a helper used to add some advanced features to layer and scene management_

== General Use Tools ==

The General Use Tools section is more general artist utilities.  Some of these tools are pipeline specific, but most should be just useful scripts to help an artist get their work done.
